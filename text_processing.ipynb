When two waves interfere with each other, they can either reinforce each other, making the combined wave stronger, or they can cancel each other out, resulting in a weaker or zero wave.\\\\n\\\\nThe strength of the interference depends on the phase of the waves, which is the position of the waves in their cycles. If the waves are in phase, meaning they are at the same position in their cycles, they will reinforce each other. If the waves are out of phase, meaning they are at opposite positions in their cycles, they will cancel each other out.\\\\n\\\\nRadio waves can interfere with each other when they are transmitted from different sources, such as two different radio stations or two different devices using the same frequency. This can cause a phenomenon called \\\"static\\\" or \\\"noise\\\" in the radio signal. However, radio waves can also be used to interfere with each other on purpose, such as in radar systems or in radio telescopes, to create a beam of radio waves that can be directed and focused on a specific target.\",\n          \"There are a few reasons why clothing stores may have more XL and XXL sizes in stock compared to smaller sizes. One reason is that larger sizes may be more popular in certain areas or among certain demographics. For example, if a store is located in a region where people tend to be larger in size, they may sell more larger sizes. Similarly, if a store caters to a particular demographic that tends to be larger in size, they may also sell more larger sizes. Another reason is that it can be more expensive to produce smaller sizes. Clothing manufacturers often have to use more fabric and pay more attention to detail when making smaller sizes, which can increase the cost of production. As a result, stores may order fewer smaller sizes to save on costs. Finally, it's important to note that clothing stores often order their inventory based on past sales data. If a store has consistently sold more larger sizes in the past, they may order more of those sizes in the future. On the other hand, if they have consistently sold fewer smaller sizes, they may order fewer of those sizes. Overall, the balance of sizes in a store's inventory is influenced by a combination of factors, including consumer demand, production costs, and past sales data.\",\n          \"Yes, it is possible to influence a company's actions by buying stock. As a shareholder, you have the right to vote at shareholder meetings and can use this right to influence the decisions made by the company. For example, you can vote for or against proposals put forward by the company's management, such as changes to the company's business strategy or the appointment of new board members. You can also engage with the company's management and other shareholders to advocate for specific actions or changes that you believe would benefit the company and its shareholders. However, it's important to keep in mind that the influence of individual shareholders can be limited, especially if they hold a small number of shares compared to other shareholders.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"human_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"They do actually . That 's why a microwave oven might slow down your wifi or you migut have to press three times on your garage door keyfob if you are also using your cordless phone . A short intro : radio uses frequencies , a concept meant to split data sources apart : radio stations , gsm operators . A frequency has a bandwidth ( how much it can carry ) , an absorbtion factor and you can tradeoff speed ( up to the max bandwidth for reliability ) . A submarine signal ( ultra low freq ) can be on / off and can be heard anywhere in the world , but it can only say yes or no . A 5GHz link can be heard around your house , but carries more than 10MBps . There are many more factors at play this this , mostly that rf waves bounce , reflect , and you never know how they reach you ( fi : an earlier reflection can cancel the current signal ) . But some applications , like GSM get their dedicated frequencies . This is good , because the frequencies most likely to cancel you out are those near to you ( this is relative ) . There are also \\\" encoding \\\" techniques , called modulation . Usually you vary a fixed frequency by the amount of your signal : if you want to transmit a 440Hz signal on a 96MHz carrier signal , you vary the 96MHz signal in sync with the 440 one : from 96 000 000 - 220 to 96 000 000 + 220 . This is called frequency modulation . This is old tech , by modern standards . Even TV broascast switched to digital , that s why you might have received a set top box , ans an old TV can no longer receive anything with just an antenna . The only globally widespread application of FM still in use is FM radio ( music , news ) mostly because digital replacements sucked and never caught on , while making an am receiver in case of emergencies is dead simple ( coil a wire with a diode / led scrapped out of anything on a tin can ) . Currently , various modulation techniques are used for digital data : bits represent specififc \\\" notes \\\" , the carrier is varied 100 times per second . For example , see [ MFSK ] ( URL_1 ) or generic [ spread spectrum ] ( URL_0 ) techniques . tl;dr : they do interfere , but modern transmit / receive techniques cancel most problems out .\",\n          \"Your observation is almost certainly a matter of perceptual bias . If you 're only looking for small size clothing , it 's frustrating when you ca n't find it and everything is X / XL instead . However , when you 're looking for clothing and you do find the right size you generally do n't remember how much X / XL was always there . As a result , virtually everyone will have the same experience of \\\" there 's never anything in my size ! \\\" even though everyone is not the same size .\",\n          \"Yes and no. This really should be taught at junior school level in a capitalist country but that is a different argument. A company is influenced by its shareholders but not in the way you are hoping. This is the only area where a Company must behave democratically with one share one vote. If you own one share in a company (specifically a voting share), then you are entitled to attend an AGM where you will have a vote on issues presented by the board. You might have an opportunity to make a statement or ask a question at the AGM, but I wouldn't rely on it. You will not be able to influence the companies behavior beyond that unless you control enough shares to influence the board. Notice I said 'control' not 'own'. If you get other shareholders to agree to vote with you, then you effectively control their shares. Shareholders are there to get a return on their investment, so you must convince them that they will get a better return by agreeing with you then by following the board (that they put there!). Convince them that (for example) a trespass lawsuit will rob the company of more value then the profit to be made and they might agree to not trespass. Morals, ethics, justice etc., are human attributes and since most shareholders are other corporations not humans, they have no place in your arguments with one exception; Goodwill is a value that appears on a balance sheet and you might be able to use emotional arguments to show that there is a risk of a loss of goodwill from the proposed actions. You can make your argument stronger by generating media pressure on customers and suppliers of the company to make critical public comments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["What happens if a parking ticket is lost / destroyed before the owner is aware of the ticket , and it goes unpaid ?

Why does this combination make the most sense?\n","The configuration that had the best results was tokenize(data, lemmatized=True, remove_stopword=True, remove_punct=True). This combination makes the most sense because lemmatization will help normalize the data by reducing the unique words in the dataset while still preserving semantic meaning of a given document in the corpus. Removing stop words and punctuation will also improve tokenization results since these types of characters don't add to the semantic meaning of the text. Stopwords and punctuation also tend to have a high frequency within a text, so by removing this noise it is much easier to extract the desired text characteristics.\n","\n","#### Do you think, overall, ChatGPT-generated answers are more posive or negative than human-generated ones?
